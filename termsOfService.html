                    customers of the
                    location and apparent availability of parking and providing customers the ability to pre-book
                    parking (the “Services”). Despite the convenience of the Services, the decision to utilize the
                    Services are solely yours and you assume the responsibility and any assumption of risk associated
                    with the Services. The allocation of parking spaces within a lot is solely under the control of the
                    lot attendant or uncontrolled if not attended. We, therefore, cannot be responsible for any
                    consequences arising from the lack of suitable parking. In all cases, the parking arrangement will
                    be governed by the agreement with the operator of the parking facility as posted at their location
                    or provided to you by them.

                <p>
                    CarPark’s liability to you or anyone else in any circumstance is limited to the lesser of (a) $100,
                    and (b) the total dollar amount of all parking booked via CarPark in the 12 months prior to the
                    action allegedly giving rise to liability. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
                    limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusions or limitations may not
                    apply to you.


                </p>
                <p>
                    In accordance with applicable state law, certain warranties or limitations of liability may not be
                    excluded and therefore may not apply to you specifically. In such case, our liability will be
                    limited to the highest extent permitted by law.

                    addition to any other rights and remedies we may have, we may seek any preliminary or permanent
                    injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction. You submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
                    of the state and federal courts located in the State of Illinois and waive any jurisdictional,

                    THESE TERMS OF USE OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.
                    YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, AS A
                    PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER, OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. YOU HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY
                    JUDGE OR JURY. HOWEVER, THIS CLAUSE WILL NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS BROUGHT BY PARKWHIZ FOR YOUR VIOLATION
                    OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, VIOLATION OF THE NON-SOLICIT CLAUSE OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR
                    VIOLATION OF THE COUPON ABUSE CLAUSE OF THIS AGREEMENT; IN WHICH CASE WE MAY SEEK INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
                    OR OTHER APPROPRIATE RELIEF IN A COURT WITH JURISDICTION.


                </p>

                <p>
                    The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance
                    with Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA
                    Rules") then in effect. The AAA Rules are available at https://www.adr.org/Rules or by calling the
                    AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with
                    applicable law for the State of Illinois and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.
                    You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any dispute or claim arising out
                    of, related to, or connected with the use of Services or Terms of Use must be filed within one (1)
                    year after such claim arose or it will be forever banned. Any arbitration will be conducted on an
                    individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding. The
                    payment of any filing and arbitration fees will be in accordance with AAA Rules.


                </p>
                <p>
                    Unless you and CarPark agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing between CarPark and a Buyer will
                    take place in the county of your billing address, and any arbitration hearing with a Seller or
                    Developer will take place in the county in which you have your principal place of business. If AAA
                    arbitration is unavailable in your county, the arbitration hearing will take place in the nearest
                    available location for AAA arbitration. If your claim is for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less,
                    the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted by all parties to the
                    arbitrator, unless determined a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds ten thousand dollars
                    ($10,000), your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. The parties agree that the
                    arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation,
                    applicability, enforceability, and formation of this clause. The arbitrator will render an award
                    within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered
                    in any court having competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on
                    all parties. The arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be available at court.
                    The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party
                    seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s
                    individual claims. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees
                    and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. The arbitrator’s decision and judgment
                    shall have no precedential or collateral estoppel effect. This Arbitration Clause shall not apply to
                    the following types of claims: 1) violation of CarPark’s intellectual property rights; 2) violation
                    of the Non-Solicit Clause of this Agreement; 3) violation of the Coupon Use Clause of this
                    Agreement; and 4) claims that may not be subject to arbitration as a matter of law.
